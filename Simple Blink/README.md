# Simple Blink

## Extra Work
The extra work done for this part of the lab was changing the LED blink speed over a UART connection. The inputs are 's' for slow speed
blink, 'm' for medium speed blink, 'f' for fast speed blink, and 'o' for off. This was implemented on the MSP430f5529 and can be run by 
importing the project into Code Composer Studio.
