# Simple Blink
This part of the project took an onboard LED and blinked it at a set rate. The duty cycle of the blinking LED was 50%, meaning it was on for as much time as it was off. The blinking was done by using a counter in a while loop, toggling the LED whenever a certain value was reached.

## Extra Work
The extra work done for this part of the lab was changing the LED blink speed over a UART connection. The inputs are 's' for slow speed
blink, 'm' for medium speed blink, 'f' for fast speed blink, and 'o' for off. This was implemented on the MSP430f5529 and can be run by 
importing the project into Code Composer Studio.
