# Button Blink

## Extra Work
The extra work implemented in this part of the lab was Button Based Speed Control. This was done by polling the button press, and adding to a counter when it was pressed. The counter had values of 0 through 4. 0 was considered off, and 4 was the highest speed of LED blinking. This code was made for the MSP430G2553. There is a small delay during the button poll to account for button debouncing.
